# How Often Does It Really Rain?

# Introduction
The challenge related to the predetermination of rainfall over a specific place at a particular point of time has always been a significant one. A stable precipitation pattern is not only crucial for the endurance of the flora and fauna, but it is also responsible for maintaining a perfect ecological balance.

# Objectives
--> Collections of global area surface precipitation data(60 0 N to 60 0 S) from ECMWF(European Centre for Medium - Range Weather Forecast) ERA 5 data set.

--> Plot the retrieved data into a single global contour.

--> To anlayze the data and establish a general trend of the retrived global precipitation.
